# Calculator

I made this calculator with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.

I made it to look similiar to the iPhone's calculator. The only difference is that the % button stands for the modulo operation sign instead of the standard % operation.

Here's my codepen <a href ="http://codepen.io/martinkwan/pen/eJXLqP?editors=1000" target="_blank">link</a> that you can preview the calculator at.
