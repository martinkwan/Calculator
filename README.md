# Calculator

I made this calculator with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.

I made it to look similiar to the iPhone's calculator. The only difference is that the % button stands for the modulo operation sign instead of the standard % operation.

This is one of freecodecamp's projects, and the code is mostly self taught. So it could definately be improved on!

# Demo

Here's my codepen <a href ="http://codepen.io/martinkwan/full/eJXLqP/" target="_blank">link</a> that you can preview the calculator at.
