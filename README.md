# Calculator

I made this calculator with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and Bootstrap.

It is meant to look like the iPhone's calculator.

However, I made the % button the modulo operation sign instead of the standard % operation.

## Demo

Here's my codepen <a href ="http://codepen.io/martinkwan/full/eJXLqP/" target="_blank">link</a> that you can preview the calculator at.
